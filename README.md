**REVERSI (my edition)**

**How to play:**

Reversi is a two-player game. The game is very simple. Each player must select a color (Black or White) and take turns. Player White goes first. If you place your disc(s) on either side of the disc(s) of the opposition, those disc(s) will be switched to your disc color. For example, if your color is white, and you were able to place your discs on either side of the black disc(s), those respective black disc(s) will be switched to white disc(s).

Refer to these scenarios:

1) Start of game

**How to win:**

The game will continue until all of the squares of the board (8 x 8) are filled with discs.

In order to win the game, your respective color must have the most number of discs on the board at the end of the game.

For example, if there are a majority of black discs on the board at the end of the game, the Player Black wins.

Refer to this scenario:

\1) Black wins: has a total of 34 discs out of 64 at the end of the game

**Customizations:**

I have added an AI mode where if the player with the respective turn (Black or White) clicks on the button, that turn will be played automatically. This mode could be used if a player wishes to play against the Computer (User vs Computer).
