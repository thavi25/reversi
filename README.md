# Reversi (My Edition)

## How to Play

Reversi is a two-player game. Each player selects a color (Black or White) and takes turns. Player White goes first. If you place your disc(s) next to the opponent's disc(s), those discs will be flipped to your color. For example, if your color is white and you place a disc next to black discs, the adjacent black discs will turn white.
